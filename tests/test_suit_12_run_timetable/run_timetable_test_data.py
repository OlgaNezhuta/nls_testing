Turn the faucet to cold while vigorously rinsing your entire body for 30 seconds. 3. Turn the water back to hot for 3 minutes. Cold for 30 seconds. 4. Repeat step 3 making sure you end with cold. This is breathtaking, but refreshing! 5. Towel-dry and dress to keep warm and comfortable. 6. Rest in a reclined position for 20 minutes.

Remember, even antidepressant medications can take up to three weeks to cause a noticeable difference. Stay with your positive new exercise routine consistently and improvement will come. TIPS FOR SUCCESS: Introduce a new sport or exercise into your routine. Warm up to avoid muscle strain. Listen to classical music as you exercise. Vary the exercise routine to increase caloric expenditure. If the climate makes it difficult to exercise outdoors, choose a shopping mall that encourages walkers or use an aerobic exercise video. Remember, thereâ€™s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing! If disability is preventing exercise, talk with a trainer at a gym, YMCA, or community center that can develop an exercise routine to accommodate your limitations. Exercise is vital to your wellness. Conclude exercise with cooling down and stretching.",
